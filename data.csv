letsR,letsR is designed to handle and analyse macroecological data such as species’ geographic distributions (polygons in shapefile format and point occurrences) and environmental variables (in raster format).,,
rSPACE,"The open-source R package, rSPACE, is for implementing a spatially based power analysis for designing monitoring programs. A sampling design can then be implemented to create replicate encounter histories which are subsampled and analysed to estimate the power of the monitoring program to detect changes in population abundance over time, using occupancy as a surrogate.",,
TR8,The TR8 package for R was built to provide plant scientists with a simple tool for retrieving plant functional traits from freely accessible online traitbases.,,
BAT,"The R package BAT - Biodiversity Assessment Tools - performs a number of analyses based on either species identities (TD) or trees depicting species relationships (PD and FD). Functions include building randomized accumulation curves for alpha and beta diversity, alpha diversity estimation from incomplete samples and the partitioning of beta diversity in its replacement and richness difference components.",,
enaR,"enaR , an r package for Ecosystem Network Analysis (ENA). ENA is an analytical tool set rooted in ecosystem ecology with over 30 years of development that examines the structure and dynamics of matter and energy movement between discrete ecological compartments (e.g. a food web).",,

ENMeval,ENMeval is an R package,,
ModestR,"New version ModestR 2.0 makes it easy to download occurrence records from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), to import shape files with species range maps such as those available at the website of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), to import KML files, to import CSV files with records of the users, to import ESRI ASCII grid probability files generated by distribution modelling software, and show the resulting records on a map.",,
RangeShifter,"The authors introduce a novel modelling platform, RangeShifter, which integrates complex population dynamics and dispersal behaviour, includes plastic and evolutionary processes, and simulates scenarios on spatially-explicit landscapes.",,
SimAssem,"SimAssem can: 1) simulate assemblages and surveys with user-specified parameters, 2) process existing species encounter history files, 3) generate species richness estimates not available in other programs, and 4) format encounter history data for several other programs.",,
diveRsity,"The authors present a new R package, diveRsity, for the calculation of various diversity statistics, including common diversity partitioning statistics, and population differentiation statistics, among others. The package calculates these estimators along with their respective bootstrapped confidence intervals for loci, sample population pairwise and global levels. Various plotting tools are also provided for a visual evaluation of estimated values, allowing users to critically assess the validity and significance of statistical tests from a biological perspective.",,
